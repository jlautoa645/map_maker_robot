This repository holds all of the code for my map maker robot project. It includes code to interact with the gpio's, Raspberry Pi peripherals, sensors, actuators, and sensor fusion using ROS.

All of the code specific to the Raspberry Pi will be utilizing the pigpio library found here: https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pdif2.html
