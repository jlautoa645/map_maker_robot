This sketch reads the encoder signals and determines:

- Pulses read from the wheel encoders each second
- Total distance traveled

Example output:

![wheel_encoders](https://github.com/jlautoa645/map_maker_robot/assets/121917210/f00ca8f6-de27-47c8-b020-90cf7049624b)

When the robot starts moving, the program will output the data every second. If the robot is stationary the output stream is halted.
